# Welcome to Flowers, Peace and Tolerance

Our world seems to consist of too much of **Us** versus **Them**; too much of I'm right so you must be wrong.  But we are all on this journey **_together_**!
I love flowers.  And while their appeal is not universal either, for me, they represent joy, peace, acceptance and tolerance.  And that is what I am trying to encourage and share.  

## Flowers 

There is nothing for sell.  Only non-copyrighted pictures to hopefully brighter your day.

## Tolerance

I strive to be better, but try to be open to where I need improvement.
